# Privacy technology for everyone!

Tiles book documents Tiles, the consumer offering, and Tilekit, the developer-facing, Rust-based Modelfile SDK.

There are a few ways to work with Tiles:

## Tiles CLI
Tiles is a private AI assistant with offline memory. The CLI is the easiest way to start using Tiles. The experience will be familiar to anyone who has worked with e.g. Ollama or LM Studio CLIs. Just download Tiles and get started with the ``tiles run`` command, which runs the recommended default memory model for your device.

## Tilekit SDK
The SDK is a Modelfile based Rust library that contains all of our model deployment tech. It's the engine that powers everything else in Tiles.

Define models using a Modelfile, the blueprint for creating and sharing models. Our implementation is optimized for fast, efficient local deployment across consumer platforms, with support for model chaining via the MIR extension currently in development.

## Tiles GUI
> To be released Q1 26.

Use the Local GUI for chats on your laptop. It includes a REST API and an integration for OpenWebUI. The experience will feel familiar to anyone who has used chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude.
