Based on specs defined by Darkshapes' [MIR](https://huggingface.co/darkshapes/MIR_) (Machine Intelligence Resource), a naming schema for AIGC/ML work, and Ollama's [Modelfile](https://docs.ollama.com/modelfile), the blueprint to create and share models. We are working on an implementation that introduces an additional MIR directive as a classification format, improving accessibility and reproducibility across the AI community and enabling practical chaining of models based on the prompt's intent.

```bash
# Base model (required)
FROM ./model.safetensors

# MIR identifier (custom extension)
# Format: mir:[domain].[architecture].[series]:[compatibility]
MIR "mir:model.art.gpt-oss:mlx-q4"

# License for this model
LICENSE """
Apache-2.0
"""

# System prompt
SYSTEM """
You are a lightweight technical model.
"""

# Prompt formatting
TEMPLATE "{{ .Prompt }}"

# Add adapters (optional LoRA layers)
ADAPTER ./adapter1.safetensors

# Runtime parameters
PARAMETER temperature 0.7
PARAMETER num_ctx 4096

# Initial message context
MESSAGE user "Hello."
MESSAGE assistant "Hi there!"

```

## MIR Reference

Copied verbatim from: [github.com/darkshapes/MIR](https://github.com/darkshapes/MIR):

> MIR (Machine Intelligence Resource)<br /><br />A naming schema for AIGC/ML work.

The MIR classification format seeks to standardize and complete a hyperlinked network of model information, improving accessibility and reproducibility across the AI community.<br />

Example:

> mir : model . transformer . clip-l : stable-diffusion-xl

```
 mir : model .    lora      .    hyper    :   flux-1
  ↑      ↑         ↑               ↑            ↑
 [URI]:[Domain].[Architecture].[Series]:[Compatibility]
```

Code for this project can be found at [darkshapes/MIR](https://github.com/darkshapes/MIR) on GitHub.

### Definitions

Like other URI schema, the order of the identifiers roughly indicates their specificity from left (broad) to right (narrow).

#### DOMAINS

> ↑Most Specific/Decentralized

###### Dev   

**Pre-release or under evaluation items without an identifier in an expected format**  
Anything in in-training, pre-public release, and items under evaluation

Meant to be created by anyone, derived from code and file analysis

- Contextual
- Layers of neural networks
- Dynamic

###### Model

**Publicly released machine learning models with an identifier in the database**  
Model weight tensors with arbitrary locations and quantitative dimensions

Meant to be created by file hosts, derived from research pre-prints

- Contextual
- Layers of neural networks
- Fixed

###### Ops

**References to specific optimization or manipulation techniques**  
Algorithms, optimizations and procedures for models

Meant to be created by code libraries, derived from research pre-prints

- Universal
- Attributes of neural networks
- Dynamic

###### Info  

**Metadata of layer names or settings with an identifier in the database**  
Information about the model and tensor specifications

Meant to be created by standards community, derived from code and file analysis

- Universal
- Attributes of neural networks
- Fixed

> ↓Most General/Centralized

#### SERIES

Foundational network and technique types.


##### Rules

- Lowercase, hyphen only
- Remove parameter size, non-breaking semantic versioning, library names

Example: `tencent-hunyuan/hunyuandiT-v1.2-diffusers`<br />
SERIES : `hunyuandit-v1`

Example: `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev`<br />
SERIES : `flux1dev`

In regex (roughly):

```
BREAKING*SUFFIX = r".*(?:-)(prior)$|.*(?:-)(diffusers)$|.\*[\*-](\d{3,4}px|-T2V$|-I2V$)"
PARAMETERS*SUFFIX = r"(\d{1,4}[KkMmBb]|[.*-]\d+[\._-]\d+[Bb][._-]).\*?$"
SEARCH*SUFFIX = r"\d+[.*-]?\d+[BbMmKk](it)?|[._-]\d+[BbMmKk](it)?"
```

#### COMPATIBILITY

Implementation details based on version-breaking changes, configuration inconsistencies, or other conflicting indicators that have practical application.


##### Rules

An additional SERIES label for identifying cross-compatibility
