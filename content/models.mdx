# Models

Our approach to model selection is to use the best model for each task within the constraints of the supported hardware. Currently, Tiles is designed to cover everyday tasks, with plans to expand into more domain-specific use cases over time. We provide a carefully tested combination of system prompts, tools, and models, so users do not need to handle model selection or scaffolding themselves.
