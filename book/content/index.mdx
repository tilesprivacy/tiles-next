# Tiles Book

Tiles book documents Tiles, the consumer offering, and Tilekit, the developer-facing, Rust-based Modelfile SDK.

There are a few ways to work with Tiles:



## Tiles CLI

Tiles is a private AI assistant for everyday use. The CLI is the fastest way to get started and will feel familiar if you have used tools like Ollama or LM Studio.

Install and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tiles.run/install.sh | sh
tiles run
```

This launches the recommended default model for your device.

## Tilekit SDK

Tilekit is a Modelfile-based Rust SDK that powers all model deployment in Tiles.

It provides:
- A Modelfile specification for defining and sharing models
- Fast, efficient local deployment across consumer platforms
- Model composition and chaining, with MIR support currently in development

Tilekit is the foundation for building custom local models and agent experiences within Tiles.
