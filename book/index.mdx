Tiles book documents Tiles, the consumer offering, and Tilekit, the developer-facing, Rust-based Modelfile SDK.


There are a few ways to work with Tiles:

## Tiles CLI
Tiles is a private AI assistant with offline memory. The CLI is the easiest way to start using Tiles. The experience will be familiar to anyone who has worked with e.g. Ollama or LM Studio CLIs. Just [download Tiles](#download), and get started with the ``tiles run`` command, which runs the recommended default memory model for your device.

## Tilekit SDK
The SDK is a Modelfile based Rust library that contains all of our model deployment tech. It's the engine that powers everything else in Tiles.

Define models using a Modelfile, the blueprint for creating and sharing models. Our implementation is optimized for fast, efficient local deployment across consumer platforms, with support for model chaining via the MIR extension currently in development.

## Tiles Local GUI
> To be released Q1 26.

Use the Local GUI for chats on your laptop. It includes a REST API and an integration for OpenWebUI. The experience will feel familiar to anyone who has used chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude.

## About

Our mission is to shape the future of software personalization with decentralized memory networks.

Tiles Privacy was born from the [User & Agents](https://userandagents.com) community with a simple idea: software should understand you without taking anything from you. We strive to deliver the best privacy-focused engineering while also offering unmatched convenience in our consumer products. We believe identity and memory belong together, and Tiles gives you a way to own both through your personal user agent.

Tiles is built for privacy conscious users who want intelligence without renting their memory to centralized providers. Our first product is an on-device memory management system paired with an SDK that lets developers securely access user memory and create deeply personalized agent experiences.

We are seeking design partners for training workloads that align with our goal of ensuring a verifiable privacy perimeter. If you're interested, please reach out to us at [hello@tiles.run](mailto:hello@tiles.run)
