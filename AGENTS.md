## Layout Preferences

### Mobile View
- **No scrolling**: The mobile view should never scroll. All content must fit within a single viewport (`100dvh`).
- Use `h-[100dvh]` with `overflow-hidden` to enforce this constraint.
- Content should be vertically centered and adjust flexibly to fit the screen.
