# Agent Instructions

## Layout Preferences

### Mobile View
- **No scrolling**: The mobile view should never scroll. All content must fit within a single viewport (`100dvh`).
- Use `h-[100dvh]` with `overflow-hidden` to enforce this constraint.
- Content should be vertically centered and adjust flexibly to fit the screen.

## Footer Consistency

### Footer Links
- All footers across pages (home, about, etc.) must remain consistent.
- The developer link should always be:
  - **Text**: "Tiles Developer"
  - **URL**: `https://developer.tiles.run`
- Never use "Tilekit SDK" or the old URL (`https://www.tilekit.dev/`) in footers.
